# Predicting Song Popularity

The goal of this project was to try to predict the popularity score (0-100) of a song based on its measurable features such as the song's duration, acousticness, tempo, speechiness, etc. I implemented 4 separate models for this project: a linear regression model, a polynomial regression model, a random forest regression model, and a neural network model. Each model's accuracy is displayed using error metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. Additionally, each model's results are displayed in a scatter plot which displays the predicted score vs actual score for the popularity of 1000 songs in the data set. We are looking for a line of best fit which has a slope of 1 and intersects the y-axis at x = 0 for optimal accuracy.
